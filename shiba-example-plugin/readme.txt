The Shiba Example is an empty or sample plugin to help you get started on writing a WordPress plugin.

== Description ==

<strong>The Shiba Example Plugin contains</strong> -
<ul>
<li>A plugin activation hook that runs when a plugin is first activated.</li>
<li>Plugin initialization functions.</li>
<li>An example plugin sub-menu page.</li>
<li>Example settings within the sub-menu page that uses the WordPress Settings API.</li>

<li>Example localization or language translation hooks. This enables others to easily add language translation capabilities to your plugin.</li>
